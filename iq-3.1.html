    const questions = [
        {
        q: "What is the synonym of “Enormous”?",
        options: ["Tiny", "Huge", "Average", "Small"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "A synonym is a word with the same or similar meaning. “Enormous” means very large. Among the options, “Huge” also means very large, making it the correct synonym. “Tiny” and “Small” are antonyms, and “Average” indicates a medium size, which doesn’t match."
      },
      {
        q: "Choose the antonym of “Generous”.",
        options: ["Kind", "Selfish", "Helpful", "Caring"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "An antonym is a word with the opposite meaning. “Generous” means giving freely. “Selfish” means concerned only with oneself, the opposite behavior. “Kind,” “Helpful,” and “Caring” are similar to generous, so they are incorrect."
      },
      {
        q: "What does “Candid” mean?",
        options: ["Deceptive", "Honest", "Reserved", "Angry"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "“Candid” describes someone who is truthful and straightforward. “Honest” matches this meaning. “Deceptive” (misleading), “Reserved” (quiet), and “Angry” (upset) do not fit the definition."
      },
      {
        q: "Which word is closest in meaning to “Persevere”?",
        options: ["Give up", "Persist", "Hesitate", "Ignore"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "“Persevere” means to continue despite difficulties. “Persist” means to keep going, making it the closest synonym. “Give up” is the opposite, “Hesitate” means to pause, and “Ignore” means to disregard, none of which match."
      },
      {
        q: "The opposite of “Optimistic” is:",
        options: ["Hopeful", "Pessimistic", "Cheerful", "Confident"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "“Optimistic” means expecting positive outcomes. “Pessimistic,” meaning expecting negative outcomes, is the antonym. “Hopeful” and “Cheerful” are similar to optimistic, and “Confident” is unrelated to optimism’s outlook."
      },
      {
        q: "What is a synonym for “Vivid”?",
        options: ["Dull", "Bright", "Vague", "Ordinary"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "“Vivid” describes something clear, intense, or lively (e.g., vivid colors). “Bright” matches this, especially for colors or imagery. “Dull” and “Vague” are opposites, and “Ordinary” means common, not intense."
      },
      {
        q: "What does “Mitigate” mean?",
        options: ["Increase", "Reduce", "Ignore", "Create"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "“Mitigate” means to make something less severe or intense (e.g., mitigate pain). “Reduce” fits this meaning. “Increase” is the opposite, “Ignore” means to overlook, and “Create” is unrelated."
      },
      {
        q: "Choose the antonym of “Fragile”.",
        options: ["Weak", "Delicate", "Strong", "Soft"],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "“Fragile” means easily broken or delicate. “Strong,” meaning sturdy or durable, is the opposite. “Weak” and “Delicate” are similar to fragile, and “Soft” refers to texture, not strength."
      },
      {
        q: "Which word means “to criticize harshly”?",
        options: ["Praise", "Condemn", "Support", "Encourage"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "To “criticize harshly” means to strongly disapprove. “Condemn” means to express strong disapproval, fitting the definition. “Praise,” “Support,” and “Encourage” are positive actions, opposite to criticism."
      },
      {
        q: "A synonym for “Obsolete” is:",
        options: ["Modern", "Outdated", "Useful", "Current"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "“Obsolete” means no longer in use or out of date. “Outdated” has the same meaning. “Modern” and “Current” are opposites, and “Useful” is unrelated to obsolescence."
      },
      // Sequence
      {
        q: "What comes next in the sequence: apple, banana, cherry, date, __?",
        options: ["Egg", "Elephant", "Evening", "Earth"],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "The sequence follows alphabetical order based on the first letter: apple (A), banana (B), cherry (C), date (D). The next word starts with E. Among the options, “Earth” starts with E, while “Egg,” “Elephant,” and “Evening” don’t fit a stricter pattern (e.g., nouns or simplicity)."
      },
      {
        q: "Find the next term: big, small, tall, short, __?",
        options: ["Large", "Wide", "Narrow", "Long"],
        answer: 3,
        explanation: "The sequence alternates size-related adjectives, with pairs of opposites: big (large), small (opposite), tall (large), short (opposite). The next term should be a “large” size adjective. “Long” fits as a size descriptor, while “Large” repeats big, “Wide” is less specific, and “Narrow” is an opposite."
      },
      {
        q: "What is the next word: red, blue, green, yellow, __?",
        options: ["Orange", "Purple", "Black", "White"],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "The sequence lists common colors, often in rainbow or familiar order. After red, blue, green, yellow, “Orange” is a logical continuation (rainbow order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, adjusted here). “Purple,” “Black,” and “White” don’t follow this pattern."
      },
      {
        q: "Complete the sequence: cat, dog, fish, horse, __?",
        options: ["Lion", "Insect", "Jaguar", "Kangaroo"],
        answer: 2,
        explanation: "The first letters follow alphabetical order: cat (C), dog (D), fish (F), horse (H). The next letter is J (skip 1 letter: C-D, D-F, F-H, H-J). “Jaguar” starts with J. “Lion” (L), “Insect” (I), and “Kangaroo” (K) don’t fit."
      },
      {
        q: "Next in sequence: first, second, third, fourth, __?",
        options: ["Fifth", "Sixth", "Last", "Next"],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "The sequence lists ordinal numbers: first (1st), second (2nd), third (3rd), fourth (4th). The next is “Fifth” (5th). “Sixth” skips a term, “Last” is vague, and “Next” isn’t an ordinal number."
      },
      {
        q: "Find the next term: sun, moon, star, cloud, __?",
        options: ["Sky", "Rain", "Wind", "Night"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "The sequence relates to sky phenomena: sun, moon, star (celestial), cloud (weather). The next term logically follows weather, with “Rain” being a direct result of clouds. “Sky” is too broad, “Wind” is less specific, and “Night” repeats moon’s theme."
      },
      {
        q: "What comes next: pen, pencil, book, ruler, __?",
        options: ["Eraser", "Table", "Chair", "Bag"],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "The sequence lists stationery items: pen, pencil, book, ruler. “Eraser” is another stationery item, fitting the pattern. “Table,” “Chair,” and “Bag” are not stationery."
      },
      {
        q: "Complete: king, queen, prince, princess, __?",
        options: ["Knight", "Duke", "Soldier", "Bishop"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "The sequence follows royal hierarchy: king, queen (rulers), prince, princess (heirs). “Duke” is the next noble rank. “Knight,” “Soldier,” and “Bishop” are not royal titles."
      },
      {
        q: "Next in sequence: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, __?",
        options: ["Sunday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Weekend"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "The sequence lists days of the week in order: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. The next is “Friday.” “Sunday” and “Saturday” skip days, and “Weekend” isn’t a day."
      },
      {
        q: "Find the next word: spring, summer, autumn, winter, __?",
        options: ["Season", "Spring", "Rain", "Snow"],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "The sequence lists seasons in cycle: spring, summer, autumn, winter. It repeats with “Spring.” “Season” is too general, “Rain” and “Snow” are weather, not seasons."
      },
      // Analogy
      {
        q: "Big : Small :: Tall : ?",
        options: ["Short", "Long", "High", "Wide"],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "Analogy shows a relationship. “Big” is the opposite of “Small.” Similarly, “Tall” is the opposite of “Short.” “Long,” “High,” and “Wide” are not opposites of tall."
      },
      {
        q: "Pen : Write :: Knife : ?",
        options: ["Cut", "Cook", "Eat", "Sharpen"],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "A pen is a tool used to write. A knife is a tool used to cut. The relationship is tool-to-function. “Cook,” “Eat,” and “Sharpen” are not the primary function of a knife."
      },
      {
        q: "Cat : Kitten :: Dog : ?",
        options: ["Puppy", "Cub", "Calf", "Foal"],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "A kitten is a young cat. A puppy is a young dog, matching the adult-to-young relationship. “Cub” (bear), “Calf” (cow), and “Foal” (horse) are incorrect."
      },
      {
        q: "Sun : Day :: Moon : ?",
        options: ["Night", "Sky", "Star", "Cloud"],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "The sun is associated with day (visible during daytime). The moon is associated with night (visible at night). “Sky,” “Star,” and “Cloud” don’t match this time-based relationship."
      },

        q: "Teacher : Classroom :: Chef : ?",
        options: ["Kitchen", "Bedroom", "Office", "Garden"],
        answer: 0,

        options: ["Watch", "Listen", "Write", "Play"],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "A book is used by reading. A television is used by watching, matching the object-to-use relationship. “Listen,” “Write,” and “Play” don’t fit."
      },

        q: "Foot : Shoe :: Hand : ?",
        options: ["Glove", "Ring", "Watch", "Bracelet"],
        answer: 0,

        options: ["Water", "Sky", "Track", "Path"],
        answer: 0,

        options: ["Apple", "Banana", "Carrot", "Mango"],

        options: ["Pen", "Pencil", "Book", "Eraser"],

        options: ["Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow"],
        answer: -1, // Special case: None (trick question)
        explanation: "All are colors, so none is different. This tests attention to detail, as exams may include such traps. Since “None” isn’t an option, re-evaluate context; all are equally valid."

        options: ["Fish", "Lion", "Cat", "Dog"],

        explanation: "In analogy, the relationship between the first pair (Circle : Square) applies to the second (Triangle : ?). A circle (curved, no sides) becomes a square (4-sided, straight). The relationship is a shift from a shape with no fixed sides to a 4-sided shape. A triangle (3 sides) becomes a rectangle (4 sides), as both are straight-sided but rectangle matches the 4-side pattern like square. Pentagon (5 Sides) and Hexagon (6 sides) don’t match, and Square repeats the second term incorrectly."
